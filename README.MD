# Some helpful tools for Typescript issues.

This project assumes that you have a working version of Typescript/Node, and are able to run `npx` commands.

Always start by running **`npm i`** on this project.

## With nodemon

**`npm start`**. You're good to go !

## If you want to build

Else, you can always run `npm run example` (or `npm run example` if you are developing on Windows ) for a working demo (the app will start by default; if you want to examine how the file structure is modified, you can edit `package.json`'s scripts.).
